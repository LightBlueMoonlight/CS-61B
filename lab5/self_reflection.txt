You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I don't know

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:I realized all the functions

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Add operation takes a long time

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: There are better methods for add and remove

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I think the prompt is enough

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: The addition and deletion are all in one array and will not depend on more arraycopy

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I don't know

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I used a single sentinel node

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Add operation takes a long time

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: The iterator can use get directly

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: I think the prompt is enough

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: No

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I like it
